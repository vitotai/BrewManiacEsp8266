# BrewManiacEx
![BrweManiacEx Architecture](./docs/bmex_arch.jpg)

BrewManiacEx is a brew controller based on ESP8266. It was started by mimicking famous Arduino-based Open ArdBir, so most of Open ArdBir functions are included.

 * Manual and Automation brewing process control
 * PID and PWM heat control
 * Automatic PUMP control

The most important feature that BrewManiacEx differs from Open ArdBir is

 * WiFi Enabled, Web-based interface
You can view, change the settings, monitor and control the brew on your phones, tablets, and computers.

Additionally,

 * Multiple sensors support
Up to 5 sensors are supported. Different sensors can be used in different stages.
 * PID autotune
Run the PID Autotune to get the best PID parameters for your system instead of guessing.
 * Sparge water Heating control
Run the sparge water heating when the main heating element is idle during mashing to enable using only one 15A/20A GFCI socket.
 * Temperature logging chart
Watching the temperature chart during brew and after brew
 * [Untested/uncompleted] Distilling
PWM controlled heating instead of PID controlled. Customized 4 stages: pre-heat, head, heart, and tail, which are defined by temperature ranges.

## NOTE:
Flash layout and File system are changed in 0.4.9. All data and setting will be lost after upgrading. Please backup before upgrading.
The major change in 0.4.9 is adapting of LitteFS, whihch is quiet new to ESP8266/Arduino framework. Although the performance is better,
the stability is in doubt. Please be aware.
