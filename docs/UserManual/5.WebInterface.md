# 5. Web Interface

## 5.0 Initial Setup

Since v0.4.2, BrewManiacEx **_always_** creates a WiFi network and serves as an AP. The SSID is the same as hostname, and the minimum length of password is 8. The network BrewManaicEx created is always password protected.

Connect your computer/phone/tablet to the network, "bm" by default, to setup WiFi connection if not yet done.

If the html/javascript files are not uploaded and BrewManiacEx is not connected to a network, a page of network selection will show up. If it doesn’t show up automatically, go to [http://192.168.4.1/](http://192.168.4.1/)

Connect BrewManacEx to the internet, so that update page can download the html/javascript files from the internet. You will have to connect to the network that BrewManaicEx connects to, so that the update page will work.

If the html/javascript files are already installed, the network setting can be accessed by "Network" tab.

The way to change network is the same as initial setup.

To set AP Only mode, check the box and **press OK**.

To change or assign network, fill the information and** press Save.**

## 5.1 Serving page

![image alt text](image_41.jpg)

BrewManiacEx will try to connect to the previously connected network at startup. If the connection is successful, the IP address will be shown. If it can’t connect to the network, it will stay at the "Setup Network.." screen and setup a network named “bm”. Using a computer or phone to connect to that “bm” network, and specify the WiFi network and optional password. If BrewManiacEx connects the network successfully, it will show the IP address on LCD.

The web interface can be accessed by browsers that support HTML5 and SSE(ServerSideEvent), like **_Chrome_** and **_Safari_**. Microsoft IE and Edge are **not** compatible due to lack of SSE support at the time of writing.

The hostname which by default is ‘bm’, can be used if mDNS is supported by your phone or computer, which is true for Apple’s products. The serving page can be accessed from

[http://bm.local](http://bm.local)    

or

http://**_[IP_****_ Address]_**

## 5.2 Main/Panel

This tab is used to control and watch the status of BrewManiacEx. There is a "cover" above the buttons to prevent fat fingers.

**_NOTE: it is not recommended to control the brew remotely._**

## 5.4 Automation

![image alt text](image_43.png)

## 5.5 Recipes

Recipes are created by the import of BeerXML files. The imported BeerXML should have the following information so that it can be used and translated into automation settings:

* Boil time

* Mash profile

The following fields are also referenced if available

* Hop and other additions schedules

    * The information will be translated into time of "Hop#1", “Hop #2”, etc.

* Water amount of first mash step

    * If the mash-in temperature is set to "calculated", this field is used in the formula to derive mash-in temperature.

Other fields are display only.

### 5.5.1 Recipe Options

![image alt text](image_44.png)

* Mash-in temperature will be inserted automatically based on the settings. The formula to calculate mash-in temperature is based on[ Palmer’s formula](http://howtobrew.com/book/section-3/the-methods-of-mashing/calculations-for-boiling-water-additions).

* Temp = R * [Grain weight] / [Water amount] * ( [First rest temp] – [Grain temp] ) + [First rest temp] + [Equipment Adjustment]

* R: is the heat capacity coefficient of grain.

* General speaking, the "Equipment Adjust" should be a minus value because the kettle is at the “mash-in” temperature when doughing in.

* A mash-out is necessary for BrewManiacEx. If the last mash step in the BeerXML recipe is in the mash-out range( >75°C), it will be regarded as the Mashout step. Otherwise a "Default Mash Out” will be inserted automatically.

### 5.5.2 Import

![image alt text](image_45.jpg)

Used to import the beer.xml file

* Your BeerXML file may contain more than one recipe, if so you can select your desired recipe.

* You can "Save" or “Brew” your recipe only if it specifies at least the Boil Time and Mash Profile.

* The saved name can’t contain special characters and spaces. The maximum length is 28.

* Caution: Using the same recipe name as an existing saved recipe will overwrite the existing saved recipe.

* You can "Brew" a recipe without having used “Save”. Pressing “Brew” button will set the automation settings.

* The "Mash-In" temperature is derived from the settings at the time it is shown. The “Mash-out” is set to a default if it is not present in the imported BeerXML file. **The original BeerXML is saved**, and you can have different Mash-In and Mash-out(if not present in the BeerXML) if you change the options before “viewing” a recipe

### 5.5.3 Saved recipe view

![image alt text](image_46.jpg)

* You can "Delete" and “Brew” the saved recipes.

* You can change the options to get a different Mash-In temperature just before you "Brew" it.

## 5.6 Calculators

For convenience when brewing a series of calculators are provided as follows

## 5.8 Network

![image alt text](image_49.png)

The serving page can be password-protected if "Always need password" option is checked. It is not protected by default.

The username, password, and hostname can be changed in "Network Settings" page. To change the setting in “Network Settings” page, the correct username and password must be provided. **_The change of network settings will be effective after next power on._**

Default values:	Host Name: bm

UserName: brewmaniac

Password: rdwhahb!  

Password before 0.4.2: bdwhahb

## 5.9 Update page

### 5.9.1 Firmware update

**_!!BE CAREFUL!! Uploading the wrong image might brick your controller._**

The firmware can be updated by uploading new *.bin file from browser at this url

http://bm.local:8008/systemupdate

### 5.9.2 Web file update

**_!!BE CAREFUL!! Messing up the files might result in misbehavior of BrewManiacEx._**

To access the SPIFFS file sytem, use the url,

http://bm.local:8008/filemanager

Take care not to mess up the files.

Be Warned! Dangerous!!!

Dangerous!!! Don’t read the following content

*There is a way to format the file system by which all the files and logs will be gone. The url is at http://bm.local/format-spiffs*

Dangerous!!! Don’t read the content brefore

### 5.9.3 Automatic OTA Update

*Functionality currently unstable** *

By accessing the url below, BrewManiacEx will check the availability of new firmware and new web page files.

http://bm.local/update

If BrewManiacEx can’t find the files, the update page will be present when main page is accessed. The data files can be downloaded from the network instead of using SPIFFS tool.
